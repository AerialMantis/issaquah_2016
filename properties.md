Abstract:           This paper generalizes and extracts the property customization mechanism from [P0443r8](http://wg21.link/p0443r8), as requested by LEWG in the 2018-11 San Diego meeting.  This document does not introduce any significant design changes from the design previously discussed in the context of P0443; the separation herein is merely a recognition of the mechanism's general applicability and is made in anticipation of its use in other contexts.
